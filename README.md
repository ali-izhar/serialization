> This application will upload statistics for USA Herd Management data. The Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA), is an Act of Congress, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon on December 18, 1971. The act covered the management, protection and study of "unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands in the United States." (Wikipedia) It also established Herd Areas (HAs) – geographic areas where wild horses and/or burros were found at the passage of the Act – and Herd Management Areas (HMAs) within Herd Areas where Land Use Plans will manage the populations of wild horses and/or burros.
